# Suno music for a city

The game's radio plays `cities/<slug>/media/music/*.mp3` when present, otherwise the bundled
soundtrack (Sandstorm Pursuit, Iron Tide, Dusk Convoy). Suno has no public API key flow here: songs are
made in the official web app with the **user's own Suno account**.

## 1. Write the song package

For each track give exactly two sections.

**Style description** — exactly 300 characters including spaces, one English paragraph, no line
breaks: genre and subgenre, mood, tempo (BPM), instruments, vocal style. For gameplay music:
instrumental, 120–140 BPM, starts at full energy (no long intro), loopable ending. Count the
characters and adjust adjectives until it is exactly 300. `theme.json` → `music` has a starting point.

Example (300 characters):
```
Instrumental desert-industrial chase music, 132 BPM. Distorted bass, detuned guitar riffs, hammered oil-drum percussion, metallic hits, gritty analog pulses and dark brass. Dusty, tense, relentless. Kick and bass from beat one; no intro, no vocals. Driving combat groove, sparse breaks, loopable end.
```

**Tagged lyrics** — structure tags `[Intro] [Verse] [Pre-Chorus] [Chorus] [Bridge] [Outro]
[Instrumental Break] [Drop]`, vocal tags `[Male Vocal] [Female Vocal] [Whispered] [Spoken Word]
[Harmony] [Ad-lib]`. For instrumentals use only structure tags with `[Instrumental Break]` and leave
Suno's lyrics box empty. A vocal anthem about the town can name its streets and landmarks
(`theme.json` → `facts`) — keep it playful, no real people.

Offer two or three contrasting tracks (e.g. a chase track, a heavier boss-wave track, a dusk cruise).
Save the packages in `cities/<slug>/media/music/prompts.md`.

## 2. Generate on suno.com

- With a browser tool: open https://suno.com/create in the user's browser. The user must already be
  signed in — never enter credentials. Use *Custom* mode, paste the style into *Style of Music*,
  lyrics (or nothing + Instrumental on) and a title. **Ask the user before clicking Create** (it uses
  their credits) and before downloading files.
- Without a browser tool: give the user the packages to paste themselves.
- Suno makes two variations per request; let the user pick. Download as MP3.

## 3. Add to the game

```sh
python3 wasteland.py music <slug> --add ~/Downloads/<file>.mp3 --title "Visby — Ring Wall Run" \
    --source https://suno.com/song/<id> --generator "Suno"
python3 wasteland.py music <slug>            # list
python3 wasteland.py music <slug> --clear    # back to the default soundtrack
```
Any MP3 the user has rights to works the same way.

## Rights

Suno's terms decide who may use the music: on paid plans the user owns the songs; on the free plan
songs are for non-commercial use and Suno keeps ownership. Tell the user before they publish the game
publicly, and keep the `--source` link for attribution.
